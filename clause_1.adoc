== Advancing Mod, Sim, Predict Convergence
//write text in as many clauses as necessary. Use one document or many, your choice!


Increasing computational power allows us to anticipate great advances based on convergence and interoperability existing capabilities in the areas of:
* Modeling and Simulation, e.g., training simulators
* Integrated environmental models, e.g., predictive geophysical computer models.
* Geo-Social modeling at several scales

OGC can bring a unique perspective and coordination to the convergent worlds of Modeling, Simulation, Prediction (MSP).  In particular OGC activity can:
* Identify the value of interoperability of geospatial MSP to making decisions
* Define concepts and semantic models that aid analysts in using MSP
    * Static and dynamic, empirical and analytic, etc.
* Interoperability methods for MSP models based on geospatial concepts, e.g., CRSs.
* Quality assessment: Effectiveness, Provenance, and Reproducibility

Cross cutting concepts
* CRS
* Time
* Geographic domains - layers, etc
* Integrative perspective
* workflow, processes, execution, WPS
* Geoscience Algorithm Integration Based on OWS Specifications:


The OGC Technology Forecasting has identified Mod, Sim, Predict as priority trend for assessment.

This note builds on previous activities in the OGC Future Directions sessions .
1. Modeling and Simulation to interact with a representation of the real world – “prediction” depends on user interaction
2. Simulation and Prediction to analyze some phenomenology - “modeling” establishes the domain of analysis.
3. Geospatial predictive modeling - a process for spatially analyzing events in order to make statements of likelihood for event occurrence
